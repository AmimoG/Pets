                    Dogs can be trained to detect drugs, explosives and diseases such as cancer. 
                    Cats have incredible hearing and can detect higher frequencies of sound than humans or even dogs. 
                    And, rabbits can reach speeds of up to 50 miles per hour!

                    Owning a pet can keep you healthy by boosting your immune system and encouraging you to get regular exercise. 
                    And, older people who regularly walk their dogs walk faster and for longer periods, and have better mobility in their homes.
