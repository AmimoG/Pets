                    Dogs can be trained to detect drugs, explosives and diseases such as cancer. 
                    Cats have incredible hearing and can detect higher frequencies of sound than humans or even dogs. 
                    And, rabbits can reach speeds of up to 50 miles per hour!

                    Owning a pet can keep you healthy by boosting your immune system and encouraging you to get regular exercise. 
                    And, older people who regularly walk their dogs walk faster and for longer periods, and have better mobility in their homes.

                    Pets can offer us so much, so they deserve our care and respect. Whether you're and experienced cat owner or are thinking of buying a puppy, 
                    we all need some advice from time to time.

                    Growing up with pets may improve children's social skills and encourages childhood responsibility. Pets can also encourage children to develop compassion, 
                    understanding and respect for living things.
